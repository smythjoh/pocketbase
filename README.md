### PocketBase
[Pocketbase](https://pocketbase.io) is a simple, self-hosted, open-source, no-code, database for your personal data.
It's a great alternative to Airtable, Notion, and Google Sheets. Source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase)

### Currently supported operations
This SDK doesn't have feature parity with official SDKs and supports the following operations:

* **Authentication** - anonymous, admin and user via email/password
* **Create** 
* **Update**
* **Delete**
* **List** - with pagination, filtering, sorting
* **Backups** - with create, restore, delete, upload, download and list all available downloads
* **Other** - feel free to create an issue or contribute

### Usage & examples

Simple list example without authentication (assuming your collections are public):

```go
package main

import (
	"log"

	"github.com/smythjoh/pocketbase"
)

func main() {
	client := pocketbase.NewClient("http://localhost:8090")

	// You can list with pagination:
	response, err := client.List("posts_public", pocketbase.ParamsList{
		Page: 1, Size: 10, Sort: "-created", Filters: "field~'test'",
	})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	log.Print(response.TotalItems)

	// Or you can use the FullList method (v0.0.7)
	response, err := client.FullList("posts_public", pocketbase.ParamsList{
		Sort: "-created", Filters: "field~'test'",
	})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	log.Print(response.TotalItems)
}
```
Creating an item with admin user (auth via email/pass). 
Please note that you can pass `map[string]any` or `struct with JSON tags` as a payload:

```go
package main

import (
	"log"

	"github.com/smythjoh/pocketbase"
)

func main() {
	client := pocketbase.NewClient("http://localhost:8090", 
		pocketbase.WithAdminEmailPassword("admin@admin.com", "admin@admin.com"))
	response, err := client.Create("posts_admin", map[string]any{
		"field": "test",
	})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	log.Print(response.ID)
}
```
For even easier interaction with collection results as user-defined types, you can go with `CollectionSet`:

```go
package main

import (
	"log"

	"github.com/smythjoh/pocketbase"
)

type post struct {
	ID      string
	Field   string
	Created string
}

func main() {
	client := pocketbase.NewClient("http://localhost:8090")
	collection := pocketbase.CollectionSet[post](client, "posts_public")

	// List with pagination
	response, err := collection.List(pocketbase.ParamsList{
		Page: 1, Size: 10, Sort: "-created", Filters: "field~'test'",
	})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	// FullList also available for collections:
	response, err := collection.FullList(pocketbase.ParamsList{
		Sort: "-created", Filters: "field~'test'",
	})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	
    log.Printf("%+v", response.Items)
}
```

Realtime API via Server-Sent Events (SSE) is also supported:

```go
package main

import (
	"log"

	"github.com/smythjoh/pocketbase"
)

type post struct {
	ID      string
	Field   string
	Created string
}

func main() {
	client := pocketbase.NewClient("http://localhost:8090")
	collection := pocketbase.CollectionSet[post](client, "posts_public")
	response, err := collection.List(pocketbase.ParamsList{
		Page: 1, Size: 10, Sort: "-created", Filters: "field~'test'",
	})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	
	stream, err := collection.Subscribe()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer stream.Unsubscribe()
	<-stream.Ready()
	for ev := range stream.Events() {
		log.Print(ev.Action, ev.Record)
	}
}
```

You can fetch a single record by its ID using the `One` method to get the raw map, or the `OneTo` method to unmarshal directly into a custom struct.

Here's an example of fetching a single record as a map:

```go
package main

import (
	"log"

	"github.com/smythjoh/pocketbase"
)

func main() {
	client := pocketbase.NewClient("http://localhost:8090")

	// Fetch a single record by ID
	record, err := client.One("posts_public", "record_id")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	// Access the record fields
	log.Print(record["field"])
}
```

You can fetch and unmarshal a single record directly into your custom struct using `OneTo`:

```go
package main

import (
	"log"

	"github.com/smythjoh/pocketbase"
)

type Post struct {
	ID    string `json:"id"`
	Field string `json:"field"`
}

func main() {
	client := pocketbase.NewClient("http://localhost:8090")

	// Fetch a single record by ID and unmarshal into struct
	var post Post
	err := client.OneTo("posts", "post_id", &post)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	// Access the struct fields
	log.Printf("Fetched Post: %+v\n", post)
}
```

Trigger to create a new backup.

```go
package main

import (
	"log"

	"github.com/smythjoh/pocketbase"
)

func main() {
	client := pocketbase.NewClient("http://localhost:8090", 
		pocketbase.WithAdminEmailPassword("admin@admin.com", "admin@admin.com"))
	err := client.Backup().Create("foobar.zip")
	if err != nil {
	    log.Println("create new backup failed")
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}
```


Authenticate user from collection

```go
package main

import (
	"log"

	"github.com/smythjoh/pocketbase"
)

type User struct {
	AuthProviders    []interface{} `json:"authProviders"`
	UsernamePassword bool          `json:"usernamePassword"`
	EmailPassword    bool          `json:"emailPassword"`
	OnlyVerified     bool          `json:"onlyVerified"`
}

func main() {
	client := pocketbase.NewClient("http://localhost:8090")
	response, err := pocketbase.CollectionSet[User](client, "users").AuthWithPassword("user", "user@user.com")
	if err != nil {
		log.Println("user-authentication failed")
		log.Fatal(err)
		return
	}
	log.Println("authentication successful")
	log.Printf("JWT-token: %s\n", response.Token)
}
```

More examples can be found in:
* [example file](./example/main.go)
* [tests for the client](./client_test.go)
* [tests for the collection](./collection_test.go)
* remember to start the Pocketbase before running examples with `make serve` command

## Development

### Makefile targets 
* `make serve` - builds all binaries and runs local PocketBase server, it will create collections and sample data based on [migration files](./migrations)
* `make test` - runs tests (make sure that PocketBase server is running - `make serve` before)
* `make check` - runs linters and security checks (run this before commit)
* `make build` - builds all binaries (examples and PocketBase server) 
* `make help` - shows help and other targets

## Contributing
* Go 1.21+ (for making changes in the Go code)
* While developing use `WithDebug()` client option to see HTTP requests and responses
* Make sure that all checks are green (run `make check` before commit)
* Make sure that all tests pass (run `make test` before commit)
* Create a PR with your changes and wait for review
